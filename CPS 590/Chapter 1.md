## Operating System
- Exploits the hardware resources of one of more processors
- Provides a set of services to system users
- Manages a secondary memory and I/O devices

## Basic Elements
- **Processor**
	- Controls the operation of the computer
	- Performs the data processing functions
	- Referred to as the *Central Processing Unit (CPU)* 
- **Main Memory**
	- Stores programs and data
	- Volatile
	- Referred to as *real memory* or *primary memory*
- **I/O Modules**
	- Moves data between the computer and external environments such as 
		- storage
		- communications equipment
		- terminals
- **System Bus**
	- Provides for communication among processors, main memory, and I/O modules

## Program Components
- PC = Program Counter
- IR = Instruction Register
- MAR = Memory Address Register -> Holds the address of the next instruction
- MBR = Memory Buffer Register -> Stores the data whether read or write
- I/O AR = Input/Output address register
- I/O BR = Input/Output buffer register
- The *Main Memory* holds all the instructions and the data
- The *I/O modules* have all the buffers
- All the information travels through the *System Bus*

## Instruction Execution
- A program consists of a set of instructions stored in memory
- Processor reads (fetches) instructions from memory -> Processor executes each instruction

## Basic Instruction Cycle

## Instruction Fetch and Execute
- The processor fetches the instructions from memory
- Program Counter (PC) holds address of the instruction to be fetched next
	- PC is incremented after each fetch

## Instruction Register (IR)
- Fetched information reaches the Instruction Register
- Processor interprets the instruction and performs required action:
	- Processor Memory
	- Processor-I/O
	- Data processing
	- Control

## Interrupts
- Interrupt the normal sequencing of the processor
- Provided to improve processor utilization
	- most I/O devices are slower that the processor
	- processor must pause to wait for device
	- wasteful use of the processor
## Common classes of interrupts
- **Program**: Generated by some condition that occurs as a result of an instruction execution, such as arithmetic overflow, division by zero, attempt to execute an illegal machine instruction, and reference outside a user's allowed memory space.
