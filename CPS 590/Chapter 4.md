## Processes and Threads
- **Resource Ownership**
	- Includes a virtual address space that hold the process image(PCB)
	- OS performs a protection function to prevent interference between processes wrt resources
- **Scheduling/Execution**
	- Execution path that maybe interleaved with other processes
	- Process has an execution state and a dispatching priority and that is controlled by the OS
- **Thread or Lightweight Process**: Unit of dispatching
- **Process or Task**: The unit of resource ownership 
- **Multi-threading**: Ability of the OS to support multiple, concurrent paths of execution within a single process
## Single Threaded Approaches
- Single thread of execution per process is referred to as a single threaded approach
- MS-DOS is an example
![[Chapter 4-20240318093958664.webp]]
## Multi-threaded Approach
- A Java run-time environment is an example of a system of one process with multiple threads
![[Chapter 4-20240318093929538.webp]]
## Process
- The unit of *resource allocation* and a unit of *protection*
- A virtual address space that holds the process image
- Protected access to:
	- Processors
	- Other processes
	- files
	- I/O resources
## One of More Threads in a Process
- Each Thread has:
	- execution state
	- saved thread context when not running
	- execution stack
	- per-thread static storage for local variables
	- access to the memory and resources of its process (shared amongst threads)
## Threads vs Processes

## Benefits of Threads
- Takes less time to create a new thread 
- Less time to terminate a thread 
- Switching between 2 threads takes less time 
- Threads enhance efficiency in communication between programs
## Thread use in a single-user system
- Foreground and Background work
- Asynchronous processing
- Speed of execution
- Modular program structure
## Threads
- Scheduling and dispatching is done on a thread basic on the OS that supports threads
- State information dealing with execution is stored in a thread level data structure
	- *suspending* a process involves suspending all threads of the process
	- *terminating* of a process terminates all threads within the process
## Thread Execution State
- Key states
	- Running
	- Ready
	- Blocked
- Thread operations associated with a change in thread state are
	- Spawn
	- Block
	- Unblock
	- Finish

## Multi-threading on a Uni-processor
![[Chapter 4-20240318100525765.webp|342]]
## Thread Synchronization
- Necessary to sync activities of the various threads
	- all threads of a process share the address space and other resources
	- any alteration will affect the other threads in the same process
## Types of Threads
- **User Level Thread**
	- All thread management is done by the application
	- Kernel not aware of its existence
	- **Advantages**
		- **Thread switching does not require kernel mode privileges
		- Scheduling can be application specific
		- ULT's can run on any OS
	- **Disadvantages**
		- System calls are blocked which in turn also blocks all other threads within the process
		- A multi-threading application cannot take advantage of multiprocessing if it is purely ULT
	- *Overcoming ULT Disadvantages*
		- converts a blocking system call into a non-blocking system call - *jacketing*
		- writing an application as multiple processes rather than multiple threads
	- *Relation between ULT states and Process States*
![[Chapter 4-20240318101414973.webp|450]]
- **Kernel Level Thread** 
	- Thread management is done by the kernel
		- no thread management is done by the application i.e. windows
	- **Advantages of KTLs**
		- Kernel can simultaneously schedule multiple threads from the same process on multiple processors
		- If one thread is blocked, the kernel reschedules another thread of the same process
		- routines can be multithreaded
	- **Disadvantage**
		- Transfer of control from one thread to another within the same process requires mode switch to the kernel

## Combined Approaches (i.e. Solaris)
- Thread creation is done in the user space
- Bulk of scheduling and syncing is done by application
## Relation between threads and processes
- *1:1* : Each thread of execution is a unique process with its own address space and resources. Unix
- *M:1*: Defined address space and dynamic resource ownership. Multiple threads created and executed. Windows, Linux
- *1:M*: Migrated thread from one process to another. Allows a thread to be easily moved among different systems. Ra, Emerald
- *M:N*: Combination of *M:1 and 1:M*. TRIX

## Database Workloads on Multiple-Processor Hardware

## Linux Tasks
- A process or task in Linux is represented by a task_struct data structure. It contains
	- *State* => executing, ready, blocked
	- *Scheduling Info* => priority, time slice allowed
	- *Identifiers* => PID, userID, groupID
	- *IPC*
	- *Links* => to parent, sibling, children
	- *Times/Timers* => processor time used so far, interval timer
	- *File system* => pointers to opened files, current directory of process
	- *Address Space* => program, data 
	- *Context* => registers, stack 
	![[Chapter 4-20240318104011772.webp|423]]
## Linux Threads
- Linux does not recognise a distinction between threads and processes
- New process is created by copying the attributes of the current process (fork or clone)
- new process can be cloned so that the it shares resources (address space (VM), signal handlers, files, IO etc)
- Processes sharing same VM operate as threads within a single process
- Both clone & pthreads make what text calls KLTs
