- **Fossil Fuels**: fossil fuels are of prehistoric origin and are extracted from the ground
- **Biofuels**: biofuels are derived from recent-growth organic matter and are typically harvested
	- These are sustainable

# Carbon-based Fuels 
## Coal
- **Coal**: formed over millions of years from rotting plant material that accumulated in warm, muddy swaps
	- Formula: C$135$ H$96$ O$9$ NS
- **Peat**: moist, fibrous in nature
- **Lignite Coal**: or brown coal, is found nearest Earth's surface
- **Bituminous Coal**: is found deeper underground
- **Anthracite Coal**: found deep underground

## Petroleum
- **Hydrocarbons** are compounds of carbon and hydrogen bonded to each other. 
- The length of the hydrocarbons vary.
- Unbranched hydrocarbons (alkanes) are gases up to C$4$, liquids from C$5$-C$16$, solids above C$16$

## Natural Gas
- Naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amount of other higher alkanes

## Energy from Carbon-based Fuels
- When the stored chemical energy is released from a substance, it is transformed into an entirely new substance
	- C + O$2$ -> CO$2$
	- E.g. When we fire a wood, molecules react with O$2$ to form new substance like, CO$2$, CO and H$2$O

## Energy From Combustion
- **Combustion** is the chemical process of burning
- The most common combustion products are CO$2$ and H$2$O

## Hydrocarbon Combustion
- A combustion reaction features a fuel and oxygen as reactants and carbon dioxide and water as products
- C + O$2$ -> CO$2$
- CH$4$ + 2O$2$ -> CO$2$ + 2H$2$O

## Energy Levels at the Molecular Level
- The energy changes are due to the rearrangement of the atoms of the reactants and products.
- Breaking bonds requires energy -> Endothermic
- Forming bonds release energy -> Exothermic
- The breaking and forming of bonds dictates if a reaction will be **endothermic** or **exothermic**

## Exothermic vs Endothermic
- **Endothermic** (Intakes Energy): The heat added to reactants is **greater** than the heat evolved by formation of products
	- Energy $products$ > Energy $reactants$
	- Energy change is positive
	- Energy is absorbed
- **Exothermic** (Releases Energy): the heat added to reactants is **less** than the heat evolved with products
	- Energy $products$ < Energy $reactants$
	- Energy change is negative
	- Energy is released

## Not All Fuels are Equal in Energy
- The fuels with the highest heats of combustion are hydrocarbons
- As the ratio of hydrogen-to-carbon decreases, the heat of combustion decreases
- As the amount of oxygen in the fuel increases, the heat of combustion decreases

## Squeezing Oil From Rock
- Oil is found underground within the pores of geological rock formations such as sandstone.

## Shale Revolutions
- A remarkable ability to unlock new resources cost effectively pushes combined United States of oil and gas output to a level 50% higher than any other country has ever managed
- US became the new exporter of oil in the late 2020s.

## Fracking! (Shale Oil)
- Drilling down into rock formations 1-3 miles beneath Earth's surface.
- A fracking fluid containing a variety of substances is then injected under pressure in order to create cracks into which natural gas and oil can flow
## Evolution of Drilling

## Refining Crude Oil
- **Petrol**: Made of a mix of alkanes and cycloalkanes with a chain length of between 5-12 carbon atoms.
	- These boil between 40 to 205 degrees Celcius
- **Diesel**: Made alkanes containing 12 or more carbon atoms
	- These boil between 250 and 350 degrees Celcius
## Fractional Distillation
- **Distillation**: used to separate crude oil into its various components
## Cracking
- **Two main type**: 
	- **Thermal Cracking**: involves breaking down of large molecule by heating them to a high temperature
	- **Catalytic Cracking**: uses a catalyst to lower the temperature required for splitting
## Reforming
- **Catalytic reforming**: involves the rearrangement of atoms within a molecule, usually starting with linear molecules and producing ones with more branches (isomers)
- Molecules with linear structures have higher boiling points than their branched isomers
- A branched hydrocarbon known as iso-octane is used to prevent engine "knock"
## Octane Rating and Gasoline Additives
- Octane rating is a standard measure of the performance of gasoline engine
- Higher octane rating runs the engine smoothly and increases engines efficiently.
- higher the octane number, the more the fuel can withstand compression before igniting
- lower the octane number, the fuel cannot withstand high compression and ignite by itself before ignition by spark plug and can damage the engine 
	- Diesel VS Gasoline internal combustion engines: *watch vid*
	- Octane number/rating: *watch vid*
## Gasoline Additives
- Gasoline additives are used to increase the octane rating.
- Elimination of octane enhancing tetraethyl lead (TEL) created a need to find substitutes
