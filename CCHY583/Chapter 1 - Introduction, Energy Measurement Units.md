# Part 1

- Energy is defined by the ability to do **work**.
- ***Work*** : A force is said to do work if, there is a displacement of the point of application in the direction of the force.
	- **Work = Force(N) . Distance(m)**
	
- ***Joule***: The S.I (Systeme Internationale) unit of energy is Joule(J)
- The unit of **Work** is *J for Joules*
	- **Work  = Force (N) . Distance (m) = N.m = J**
	- Example:
		- How much work is done when a force of 10 N moves an object through a distance of 2 meter?
			- W = 10 x 2 = 20 Nm = 20 J

-  **Power**: It is the work done per unit time.
	- *Power = work / time*
	- Unit of power in the S.I. is the **Watt (W)**.
		- **Power = Work / time = J / s = W**
		- 1Watt = 1Joule / 1sec

- **Energy in kWh**
	- The kilowatt hour (kWh) is a unit of energy equivalent to 1 kW of power sustained for one hour.
	- 1 kW = 1000 Watts
	- How many units (kWh) of energy are consumed by a bulb of 60 watts per hour?
		- 0.06 units of energy. (60 / 1000) kWh = 0.06 kWh

- **Power vs Energy**
	- **Power is the work performed per unit of time** whereas, *energy is the work performed over a period of time*.
	- Unit of **Power** is watts(w) or joules(j)/sec(s). Unit of **Energy** is watt hours (kilo watt hours)
		- How much will be the electric bill if a refrigerator of 150 watts is powered on for 200 hours, provided that the cost of electricity is $ 0.07 per kwh.
			- There are two different types of units
				- P (W) = Work / time(s)
				- P (kW) = Work / time(h)
			- We will use the kW formula as the time is in hours
				- 150/1000 (kW) = Work / 200(h)
				- (150/1000) (kW) * 200 (h) = 30 kWh
				- Work = 30 kWh
				- Cost = $0.07 * 30 kWh = $2.1

## Commonly used Energy Units
- **Cal**: The calorie (cal) is equal to 4.184 J. *1 cal is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1oC at 1 atm pressure.*  
- **Btu**: *British thermal unit* (used in the British system of units) is commonly used in the heating and air-conditioning industries (1 Btu = 1.055 kJ). *One Btu is the amount of energy required to increase the temperature of 1 lb of water from 14.5 to 15.5F.*  
- **Therm**: The Therm (1 therm) is a larger unit in the British system (1 them = 105 Btu or 1.055 * (10^8)  J).  
- **Quad**: Quad (1 Q) is an extremely large amount of energy (1Q = to 1015 Btu or, ~ 1018 J).  
- **eV**: The electron volt (eV) is extremely small amounts of energy, usually related to atoms or nuclei * (1eV = 1.6 * 10^(-19) J)
## Energy from Coal, Oil and Gas
- **Ton**: 1 ton of coal (1 tce) which is equal to 2.931 * 10^10 J
- **Barrel**: 1 barrel of oil (1 bbl) which is equal to 6.119 * 10^9 J
- **Cubic Foot**: 1 cubic foot of natural gas (1 scf) when measured at standard pressure and temperature (1 atm and 25C) is equal to 1.072 * 10^6 J

## Various Forms of Energy

![[Pasted image 20240116211705.png]]
## Forms of Energy
- **Kinetic Energy**: Due to movement
	- All moving objects - running water, wind etc
- **Potential Energy**: Position or composition
	- Batteries, biomass, petroleum, natural gas, coal etc

## LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY

> [!NOTE]
> *Energy cannot be created nor destroyed*, although it can be changed from one form to the other. It implies that although the form of energy change, the total amount of *energy before and after any transformation remains the same*.

## Primary sources of energy
- The Sun (thermal and electric)
- Geoothermal energy from cooling, chemical reactions and radioactive decay in the Earth
- The gravitational potential and planetary motion among Sun, Moon and Earth
- Nuclear energy from nuclear reactions on the Earth
- Chemical energy from reactions among mineral sources
- Fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum products and natural gas

# Part 2 - Energy Supply and Demand

- **Global Coal Distribution**: China and the USA supply nearly 1/2 and 1/4 of the world's coal
- **Global Petroleum Distribution**: Saudi Arabia, U.S.A. and Russia together supply more than 1/2 of the worldâ€™s petroleum supply. Remaining 1/2 of world supply of petroleum is supplied by developing countries (primarily in S.W. and Central Asia)
- **Global Natural Gas Distribution**: 
	- 1/3 of natural gas production is supplied by Russia and S.W. Asia  
	- 1/3 by developing regions  
	- 1/3 by developed countries (primarily the U.S.)

## Global Oil Reserves

## Global Energy Consumption by Region

## Pathway for energy mix
- **1975**: Advanced economies consume 2/3 of fossil furls globally
- **1977**: Fossil fuels provide 70% of electricity generation
- **1990**: Annual average efficiency improvement over past decade <1%
- **2002**: 650 million cars on the road globally
- **2022**: Half of heating units sold use fossil fuels 
- **2030**: Annual average efficiency improvement since 2022 >2%. Emerging market and developing economies consume 2/3 of fossil fuels globally
- *2030 - 2040*: Solar PV becomes largest source of electricity generation
- **2040**: 650 million electric cars on the road globally
- **2050**: Half of heating units sold are heat pumps or electric heaters. Renewable provide 70% of electricity generation

### **Summary**
- Demand for energy is going to increase significantly
	- Growing populations
	- Rising standards of living
- Supply of energy is not increasing as fast
	- Fossil fuels supplies are finite
	- Oil peak is likely coming in next 30-40 years

## Hubert Peak Theory : Only a Hypotheses
- *M.King Hubbert* is known for the **Hubbert Curve** and **Hubbert Peak Theory**
	- For any given geographical area (individual oil-producing region or the planet as a whole) the rate of petroleum production tends to follow a bell-shaped curve
	- *t* is the time and *y* is the normalized fraction of the resource that is consumed
	- ![[Pasted image 20240122124621.png]]
	- Hubbert curve and the Hubbert peak are not part of a physical law but just a hypothesis
